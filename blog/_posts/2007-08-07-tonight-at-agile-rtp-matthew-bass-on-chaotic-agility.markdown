If you're in or around the Triangle tonight, come hear RailsConf 2007 speaker [Matthew Bass](http://matthewbass.com/) as he talks about the philosophy he's dubbed "Chaotic Agility."  It should be a good time, and Matthew assures me that, despite the title of the presentation, he won't be trying to sway us toward embracing [CMMI Level 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model#Level_1_-_Initial "Capability Maturity Model - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")...at least not *this* month.  The meeting starts at 6:00 PM, and you can check out all the details on the [Agile RTP site](http://agile.meetup.com/29/calendar/6008814/?a=nr1_nr "Chaotic Agility -  Agile RTP").
