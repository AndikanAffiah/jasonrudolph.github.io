More recently, Jason can be found working on [Tarantula](http://github.com/relevance/tarantula "Tarantula (Ruby Gem) - Tarantula is a big fuzzy spider. It crawls your Rails application, fuzzing data to see what breaks."), [Blue Ridge](http://github.com/relevance/blue-ridge "Blue Ridge (Rails Plugin) - Command-line and in-browser JavaScript unit tests for your Rails app"), and other Ruby and Rails projects dedicated to testing and improving code quality.

Jason holds a degree in Computer Science from the University of Virginia.  He currently lives in Raleigh, NC with his wife (who can take a functional web app and make it actually look good) and his dog (who can outrun him, but is no match for squirrels).
