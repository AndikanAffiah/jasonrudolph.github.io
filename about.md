<img src="/images/jasonrudolph-dropshadow.jpg" class="inline-left" title="Jason Rudolph" alt="Jason Rudolph" /> Jason Rudolph is a Partner at [Relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com "Relevance, Inc - Agile Software Development, Consulting, and Training"), a leading consultancy and training organization specializing in Ruby, Rails, Groovy, and Grails, and integrating them into enterprise environments.  Jason has more than ten years of experience in developing software solutions for domestic and international clients of all sizes, including start-ups, Dow 30 companies, and government organizations.

Jason is the author of the book, [Getting Started with Grails](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/grails "InfoQ: Getting Started with Grails"), and [speaks frequently at software conferences and user groups](/events).  Jason also contributes regularly to the open source community.  He was an early committer to [Grails](http://grails.org "Grails - Groovy Web Application Framework"). More recently, Jason can be found working on [Tarantula](http://github.com/relevance/tarantula "Tarantula (Ruby Gem) - Tarantula is a big fuzzy spider. It crawls your Rails application, fuzzing data to see what breaks."), [Blue Ridge](http://github.com/relevance/blue-ridge "Blue Ridge (Rails Plugin) - Command-line and in-browser JavaScript unit tests for your Rails app"), and other Ruby and Rails projects dedicated to testing and improving code quality.

Jason holds a degree in Computer Science from the University of Virginia.  He currently lives in Raleigh, NC with his wife (who can take a functional web app and make it actually look good) and his dog (who can outrun him, but is no match for squirrels).
