## Working Around [Jekyll Issue #363](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/363) 

As of v0.11.0, Jekyll no longer includes dotfiles (including .htaccess).
This issue still exists in v0.11.2.

Until a new version (e.g., v0.11.3, v0.12.0, or v1.0.0) is released, use
a locally-built version of Jekyll which includes the fix for issue #363.
